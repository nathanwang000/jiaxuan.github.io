Principal Component Analysis

* Projection matrix
  \begin{equation}
  \theta = (A'A)A'X
  \end{equation}

* PCA
** Maximizing variance along principal component direction
E((x*u - E(x*u))^2) where u is a principal component (assuming orthonormal), x is a data point

The above formulae can be shown to reduce to the following form:
we want to maximize w.r.t u:
u' * E((x-E(x)) * (x-E(x))') * u
where E((x-E(x)) * (x-E(x))') is called second moment matrix (in this context, it is also the sample variance matrix)

E((x-E(x)) * (x-E(x))') = X*X'
** Minimizing reconstruction error (TOBE written)

* SVD
A = U*sigma*V
A'A = (U*sigma*V)' * (U*sigma*V) = V'*(sigma^2)*V
from the above equation, it should be clear that V is the matrix having the eigenvectors of A'A as columns
** relation with PCA
U = eigenvector of AA'
V = eigenvector of A'A

* LSA
latent syntax analysis
** turn a sparse matrix into dense matrix
